This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves the `react-native-reanimated` library.  The build process fails with an error message indicating issues with the native modules of `react-native-reanimated`, often related to missing dependencies or linking problems.  The exact error message can vary, but it typically involves terms like 'undefined symbol' or 'cannot find symbol'.  The code itself might appear correct, but the underlying native Android build process encounters problems integrating the library. For example, a section of the app's code might use `react-native-reanimated` to create animations or gestures, which would not function correctly if this linking/dependency problem isn't addressed.
