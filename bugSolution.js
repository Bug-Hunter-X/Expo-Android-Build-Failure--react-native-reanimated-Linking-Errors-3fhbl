The issue is often resolved by ensuring that the native Android build system correctly links the required native modules.  The following steps outline a potential solution:

1. **Clean the project:**  Use `expo prebuild --clean` to remove old build artifacts. 
2. **Reinstall packages:** Run `expo install` to ensure packages are up-to-date and correctly installed. 
3. **Check for conflicting packages:** Look for conflicts between versions of packages in your `package.json`. Resolve inconsistencies if found.
4. **Eject from Expo (if necessary):** In some stubborn cases, you may have to consider ejecting from managed workflow (if using Managed workflow). This gives you more control over the native build process but loses some of the simplicity of Expo.  Only resort to this as a last resort.
5. **Verify Android configuration:** Verify that the Android native build environment is correctly set up. This involves making sure you have the right Android SDK tools, NDK, and build tools installed.

If the problem persists, you can also try to update `react-native-reanimated` to the latest version or search for more specific solutions based on the exact error message you receive during the build.
